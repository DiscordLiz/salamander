You can drop extensions in here which should not be comitted and are for a specific instance.

These extensions should store their data in the relative path (relative to working directory) "local_data/"
Resolution of conflicts with this is on the person adding extentions here to resolve.
Extensions placed here which modify the core or contrib settings are not supported behavior
(request a documented API if you need something from these)
